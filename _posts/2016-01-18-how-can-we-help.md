How Can We Help You

**Chiropractic Adjustment**

The chiropractic adjustment is a passive manipulation of the spinal joints, to restore proper joint motion, reduce nerve irritation and pain, soft tissue inflammation, and restore circulation.  The spinal joint restriction in movement or alignment is often called a _Vertebral Subluxation.  _A vertebral subluxation can happen with a trauma, sports injury, slips and falls, or on a daily basis from postural strain and lack of movement.   

**Chiropractic Benefits**

Once the spinal joints move more correctly and the Subluxation is corrected, then you can start to strengthen what is between the spinal joint; muscles, nerves and ligaments.  Over time the tissues will begin to heal and re-model.  This is to say the muscles between the spinal joints become stronger,   the ligaments gain more elasticity and strength, the affected nerves begin to fire more completely to control joint motion and mobility.   With Chiropractic care and _proper exercise_ you can slow down spinal degeneration, correct and strengthen posture, experience fewer relapses or re-aggravation.
